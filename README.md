# Posture!Posture!Posture! Chrome / Firefox Extension

This extension helps you keep track of your posture as you surf the web by first taking a baseline of you sitting with good posture, and then applying a 'blur' effect when you start to deviate from your recorded "good posture" position. As soon as you sit back up, the blur goes away and you're back to browsing!

# Privacy 
For the extension to work as you browse it needs the "view all pages" permission. I didn't put any analytics libraries or tracking so none of your data is being monitored or ever leaves the extension. The only insight I have is the standard Chrome Webstore stats that appear in the Developer Dashboard, which just tells me how many people have installed / uninstalled the extension, and # of active users.
